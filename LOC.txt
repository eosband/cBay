cBay is composed of a frontend and backend system across two repositories.

Both of these repositories contain identical modules for type information that 
both frontend and backend share. These modules include User, Item, Offer, 
Transaction, Basic. 

The remainder of the frontend repository is unique to the frontend containing
modules for frontend purposes.

The remainder of the backend repository is unique to the backend containing
modules for backend purposes.

When constructing our LOC count, we add these 3 components as shared modules + 
unique frontend code + unique backend code. 

LOC Breakdown:
Shared modules: 163
Unique backend: 1488
Unique frontend: 948
Total system: 2,599


NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE: for whoevers reading this (not related to lines of code) but
when running make docs to produce documents for both our frontend and backend, 
you may receive errors initially due to packages. These errors should not affect
the docs... proceed as if everything were chill. -ceo and founder of cBay, tedi
